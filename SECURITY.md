# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At this time due to the early status of development for YSCE, only the latest YSCE code and upstream build of YSFlight proper are supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the event of a vulnerability that can be used in remote access, remote code execution or other severe vulnerabilities, please contact nodo@kahanamura.com immediately with all appropriate details.

This vulnerability will then be reviewed by the YSCEDC and will be approved or denied if it can (or cannont) be replicated. Updates will be provided in a timely manner as the situation develops.

We ask politely that any security vulnerabilities not be publicly disclosed until they are patched by the development team and committed to both source and the latest available build.
